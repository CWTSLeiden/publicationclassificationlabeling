## Introduction

This Java package can be used to obtain labels for clusters of scientific publications. These clusters can be created using the publicationclassification package.

Labels are obtained based on the titles of a sample of publications in each cluster. The package uses OpenAI GPT language models. It supports the [GPT-3.5 and Updated GPT-3.5 Turbo models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-3-5) as well as the [GPT-4 and GPT-4 Turbo models](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4-and-gpt-4-turbo).

The publicationclassificationlabeling package was developed by [Nees Jan van Eck](https://orcid.org/0000-0001-8448-4521) at the [Centre for Science and Technology Studies (CWTS)](https://www.cwts.nl) at [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en).

## Documentation

Documentation of the source code of publicationclassificationlabeling is provided in the code in `javadoc` format. The documentation is also available in a [compiled format](https://CWTSLeiden.github.io/publicationclassificationlabeling).

## Installation

### Maven

```
<dependency>

## Usage

The publicationclassificationlabeling package requires Java 8 or higher. The latest version of the package is available as a pre-compiled `jar` file on [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/nl.cwts/publicationclassificationlabeling) and [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/CWTSLeiden/publicationclassificationlabeling/packages).
Instructions for compiling the source code of the package are provided [below](#development-and-deployment).

Use the command-line tool `PublicationClassificationLabelingCreator` to obtain cluster labels. The tool can be run as follows:

```
java -cp publicationclassificationlabeling-1.0.0.jar nl.cwts.publicationclassificationlabeling.PublicationClassificationLabelingCreator
```

If no further arguments are provided, the following usage notice will be displayed:

	of long labels, a column of keywords, a column of descriptions, and a column of Wikipedia 
	page links. Cluster numbers are integers starting at zero.
<server>
	SQL Server server name. A connection will be made using integrated authentication.
<database>
	Database name.
<pub_titles_table>
	Name of the publication titles input table. This table must have two columns: cluster_no 
	and pub_titles. The cluster numbers in the first column must be integers starting at zero. 
	The publication titles in the second column (e.g., the titles of a sample of 100 
	publications) must be concatenated into a single string.
<label_table>
	Name of the labels output table. This table will have six columns: cluster_no, 
	short_label, long_label, keywords, summary, and wikipedia_url. Cluster numbers are 
	integers starting at zero.

	OpenAI API key.
<gpt_model>
	OpenAI GPT model. The models supported are: 'gpt-4-1106-preview', 'gpt-4', 
	'gpt-3.5-turbo-1106', and 'gpt-3.5-turbo'.
<print_labeling>
	Boolean indicating whether the generated publication classification labeling should be 
	printed to the standard output or not.
```

### Example

The following example illustrates the use of the `PublicationClassificationLabelingCreator` tool. Suppose you have a text file `cluster_pub_titles.txt`:
